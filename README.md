You are a data engineer at a Brazil-based weather prediction startup called Curu-SightLinks to an external site.. The goal of this startup is to analyze weather trends in Brazil and predict the output of non-durable consumer goods at harvest time.

One major threat to Brazil's biggest export, coffee, is leaf rust (barring tariffs). This fungus thrives in humid environments and causes plants to wither. Your company recently won a contract with the local government of Minas Gerais to analyze how humidity (and auxiliary measures) determine the yearly output of coffee.

You will collect data on relative humidity, precipitation, temperature, surface pressure, soil temperature, and soil moisture in Minas Gerais using the open-meteoLinks to an external site. weather API. After transforming this dataset into a CSV file, you will perform exploratory data analysis to discover how yearly weather trends influence harvest outcomes.
